# **Reporting Security Issues**

The project's team and community take security issues.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, go to the project's issues and create a new issue using the ⚠️ Security Report 'issue template'.

Read carefully the instructions of this issue template, and if your report could leak data or might expose how to gain access to a restricted area or break the system, please email [jgracia9988@gmail.com](mailto:jgracia9988@gmail.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We'll endeavour to respond quickly, and will keep you updated throughout the process.
